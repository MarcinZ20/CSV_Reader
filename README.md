# CSV Reader


This is a simple app to help you deal with **.csv** files. 

It's written in python and based on a very popular Pandas module.


## Project structure

Code is located in the **dev** folder, which consists of 3 files:
- main.py 
- GUI.py
- CsvReader.py

The rest is self-explainatory ...

## Setup

1. First choose the space where you want to store the project and navigate there in your terminal - you can use  `cd [path_to_folder]`
2. Clone this repo by typing `git clone https://github.com/MarcinZ20/CSV_Reader.git`
3. Go to the project root directory by typing `cd CSV_READER`
4. Install dependencies by typing `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. You're all set!

## Running

To run just type `python3 ./dev/main.py`

# Warning 

Keep in mind that this is not a production version - I wrote it in one day, hence it needs a lot of improvement
